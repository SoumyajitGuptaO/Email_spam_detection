# Email Spam Detection App

## Overview

The Email Spam Detection App is a machine learning-based application designed to accurately classify email messages as **spam** or **not spam** (ham). By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and classification techniques, this app helps users filter out unwanted and potentially harmful emails, improving productivity and security.

## Features

- **Accurate Spam Detection:** Utilizes trained ML models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, or Deep Learning) for reliable classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple UI for uploading emails or pasting email content.
- **Real-Time Prediction:** Instantly determines if an email is spam or not.
- **Dataset Support:** Compatible with popular spam datasets (such as the UCI SMS Spam Collection).
- **Visualization:** Displays statistics and visual insights on email classifications.
- **Customizable:** Easily retrain the model with your own data.
